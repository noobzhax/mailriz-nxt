title: Worker configuration
description: Every variable the Worker reads, and what changes when you alter it.
---

Set by `mailriz-cli setup` and `update`. You can edit them in the Cloudflare
dashboard under the Worker's settings; a redeploy through the CLI will reset
them to what its config says, so prefer changing things through the CLI where
one exists.

## Identity and routing

| Variable | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `ADMIN_EMAIL` | the single address allowed to read the mailbox |
| `MAIL_DOMAIN` | the zone apex mail arrives on — **where aliases live** |
| `DASHBOARD_HOSTNAME` | where the dashboard is served |

`MAIL_DOMAIN` and `DASHBOARD_HOSTNAME` are deliberately different values.
Aliases belong to the mail domain; the dashboard host receives no mail. If
`MAIL_DOMAIN` is unset the catch-all rejects everything rather than accepting
all mail — a missing value must not mean "accept anything".

## Authentication

| Variable | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `AUTH_MODE` | `access` or `session` |
| `ACCESS_TEAM_DOMAIN` | your Zero Trust team domain |
| `ACCESS_AUD` | the Access application's audience tag |

In access mode the Worker rejects every request while `ACCESS_AUD` is empty, so
it must be set before the deploy that uses it — which is why setup creates the
Access application first.

### Session secrets

These two are **secrets**, not variables — they are set with
`wrangler secret bulk` and do not appear in the Worker's plain-text settings.

| Secret | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `SESSION_PASSWORD_HASH` | `pbkdf2:<iterations>:<salt>:<hash>` of the dashboard password |
| `SESSION_SIGNING_KEY` | 32 random bytes; HMAC key for the session cookie |

Both are required in session mode. If either is missing, or the hash is not in
that format, the Worker answers 500 on every request rather than falling back
to something weaker. See [Authentication](/mailriz-nxt/en/internals/auth/).

### Telegram secret

| Secret | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` | the bot token from `@BotFather`, used to send new-mail notifications |

Also a secret, set by `mailriz-cli setup`, `update` and `reconfigure` through
`wrangler secret bulk` — never a plain variable. An **empty** value is the
"off" signal: skipping the prompt in the wizard clears a previously deployed
token. Without it the dashboard still shows the settings, but nothing is ever
sent. See [Telegram notifications](/mailriz-nxt/en/guides/telegram-notifications/).

### Bindings for auth

| Binding | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `LOGIN_LIMITER` | rate limits `POST /api/login` (5 per minute per IP) |

Without the binding, login still works but is not rate limited, and the Worker
logs a warning once.

## Retention

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `TRASH_RETENTION_DAYS` | `30` | how long trashed mail survives the daily purge |

Only trashed mail is purged. Inbox and archived mail is kept until you delete
it.

## Live updates

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `UPDATES_POLL_MS` | `4000` | how often an open stream checks for new mail |
| `UPDATES_PING_MS` | `20000` | keep-alive interval |
| `UPDATES_CONNECTION_MS` | `180000` | how long a connection lives before reconnecting |

Unlike the variables above, these three are **not written by the CLI**. The
Worker falls back to the defaults when they are absent, so they only exist if
you add them yourself in the Cloudflare dashboard.

`UPDATES_POLL_MS` is the lever if live updates keep dropping on **Workers
Free**: every poll inside a connection spends from the same 10 ms CPU budget,
so a longer interval means fewer polls per connection. Raising it also raises
the delay before new mail appears.

Lowering `UPDATES_CONNECTION_MS` reconnects more often, which resets the budget
more often at the cost of more requests.

## Bindings

| Binding | Resource |
|---|---|
| `DB` | the `mailriz` D1 database |
| `RAW_BUCKET` | original `.eml` |
| `ATTACHMENTS_BUCKET` | attachments |
| `HTML_BUCKET` | sanitised HTML bodies |
| `ASSETS` | the dashboard's static files |

## Assets routing

The generated Wrangler config sets two options that matter:

- `not_found_handling: "single-page-application"` — so reloading a client-side
  route serves the app instead of 404ing.
- `run_worker_first: ["/api/*"]` — so that fallback can never answer an API
  call. Without it, a navigation request to an API path (an iframe loading a
  message body, for instance) receives the dashboard shell instead.
