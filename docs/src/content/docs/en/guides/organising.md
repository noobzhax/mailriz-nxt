## Mailbox and folder are separate

The sidebar picks the **mailbox**: all mail, one alias, or one label. The rail
inside picks the **folder**: Inbox, Starred, Archived, Trash.

They combine. Selecting `@news` and then **Starred** shows that alias's starred
mail — not everyone's. The breadcrumb names both:

```
MailRiz / @news · Starred
```

![The mailbox scoped to one alias: only that alias's mail is listed, and the
breadcrumb reads MailRiz / @bank · Inbox](../../../../assets/screenshots/alias-scope.jpg)

**All mail** at the top of the sidebar returns to the unscoped view.

## The URL follows

Everything on screen lives in the address bar, so reloading, bookmarking, and
the back button all land where you were:

```
/inbox                      all mail, inbox
/starred                    all mail, starred
/alias/:aliasId/inbox       one alias
/label/:labelId/trash       one label
…/:emailId                  with a message open
?q=…                        search
```

Bookmark `/alias/<id>/inbox` to open straight into one address.

## Search matches prefixes

Typing `jan` finds `jane` — you do not have to complete the word. Every term
must match, each as a prefix, so `jan doe` narrows rather than widens.

![Searching "pine" matches two messages — one whose sender is Pine Press, one
that only mentions it in the subject](../../../../assets/screenshots/search.jpg)

Search runs over subject, sender, and body text, and is scoped to the mailbox
and folder you are in.

Switching mailbox clears the search. Landing in an apparently empty Trash
because a filter carried over reads as a bug, so it does not follow you.

## Mail arrives on its own

New mail appears in the list without a refresh, usually within about four
seconds. There is nothing to enable.

The small dot on the refresh button shows the state of that connection:

| Dot | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Green | connected — new mail will appear on its own |
| Grey | disconnected — press refresh to check manually |

A brief grey moment every few minutes is normal: connections are deliberately
short-lived and the browser reconnects. Persistent grey means live updates are
not working — see [Troubleshooting](/mailriz-nxt/en/operations/troubleshooting/).

New mail sorts to the top, so it appears there. If you had pressed **Load
more**, an arrival returns the list to the first page.

## Labels

Colour-coded and listed in the sidebar. Selecting one scopes the mailbox to it,
exactly like selecting an alias, and the folder rail keeps working inside it.
