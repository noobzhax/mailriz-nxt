/**
 * Subscribe to new-mail notifications.
 *
 * The stream only reports *that* something arrived. Reloading is left to the
 * caller, which goes through the normal list query and therefore already
 * knows the active folder, alias, label and search — the stream never has to
 * learn any of that.
 *
 * Reconnection is `EventSource`'s own, not ours: the server closes each
 * connection after a few minutes to stay inside the Worker CPU budget, and
 * the browser dials back automatically, replaying the last event id so
 * nothing that landed in the gap is missed.
 *
 * Cookies ride along on same-origin EventSource requests, so this works under
 * both session auth and Cloudflare Access without setting any header — which
 * EventSource could not do anyway.
